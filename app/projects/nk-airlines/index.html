                <p>That's some harsh copy to use...but it's the truth, in the end. Customers who book Spirit Airlines at the moment know (or don't know) that they're going to get hit with enough fees to make it seem like you are paying for the air you breathe on the flight (I just gave them no love at all).</p>
                <p class="break">The goal was to introduce 2 sections on 2 emails: a baggage purchase section on Accept and a check-in section on Pre-Travel, just to introduce a couple of extra opportunities to make the customer's trip a bit more manageable. The design and messaging was pretty straightforward and I followed Spirit's lead on their current examples that they send out.</p>
                <p class="break">I ended up working with one of the business directors on the Air team, as well as with a couple guys from Spirit, to implement their updates. Aside from delivering the design, there were some technical challenges due to concerns on our side about serving PII through URLs, which took some time to hash out and figure out some proper workarounds in the interim.</p>

                <p class="break">Unfortunately, by the time I picked up this project it was towards the end of Q4 and most people we already going on vacation so the responses were very very slow, but the sections were eventually implemented.</p>
