                <p>We were working with a partner throughout last year called PowerInbox. Now, I respect what they do, but they were very difficult to work with. But, with that said, we decided to try something they hadn't really done before for our Cyber Monday campaign. We were also going to do similar for Black Friday, but decided to just make that one a bit different from what we normally sent.</p>

                <h4 class="text-left">black friday.</h4>
                <p class="break">For Black Friday, to me, since we were doing a 72-hour sale, it was all about honoring that. I wanted to do some playful versions with cross-outs and scribbles through Friday (since we sent on Wednesday), but some people weren't getting the message clearly enough. The end result was still very successful and it's follow up was also successful. It was one of the lightest and cleanest templates I've built to date.</p>

                <p>Cyber Monday was the more fun one.  we actually went with a "countdown" coupon template. Basically, throughout the day the coupon value would change. The idea was to set urgency around the discounts. It ended up being quite successful, but I hope I never have to build it again. I provided all the specs and did all the follow-up testing with PowerInbox to make sure we were good to go on the day of send.</p>
