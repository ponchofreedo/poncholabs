                <h4 class="text-left">overview.</h4>
                <p>This template was a kick-off to a much larger scope of processes that the Hotel Sales team was interested in having us contribute to or take over. The scope of this particular part of the project was to take over a process for a template that they call the <b style="font-weight:500">pricing guidance</b> template.</p>
                <p class="break">To my understanding, because it still doesn't make 100% sense to me (but I'm not a sales person), this template is sent on a weekly basis to individual properties and reports on how they're loaded rates or potential rates (and OPQ rates) will perform in their area.</p>
                <p class="break">The original template started off as a typical Microsoft Outlook, ugly, terrible, written out template with some data tables...truly not clean and also not responsive (in case they cared). There was no brand, so the end user probably just coasted right past the email and didn't digest the information.</p>
                <img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/hotel-sales/old.png" />
                <span class="caption">As we can see, this one was ugly and somewhat hard to interpret.</span>
            </article>
            <article style="padding-top:48px;">
                <h4 class="text-left">the redesign.</h4>
                <p>As I said, the original was pretty horrible. I had no idea what anything meant, and to that point, no data was called out as significant or insignificant. My approach was to make all of this information, even the contact information, easier to digest and understand. Also, for bonus points, the secondary goal for the design was to make this template more "on brand." To my point earlier, you could go right through this template and have no idea it was from priceline unless you read the email address...so I wanted to change that.</p>
                <img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/hotel-sales/new.png" />
                <span class="caption">The newer and more user-friendly design.</span>
                <p class="break">The resulting design got very positive reviews from the Hotel Sales team and was the first step toward taking over more processes for them and integrating into Hawkeye. Data points are better called out, the brand is represented better, and the copy is much more detailed while not being overwhelming. However...the test for these templates has ended for now and will pick up again in Q2 (I think).</p>
